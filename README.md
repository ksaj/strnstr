# strnstr()

I kept finding perfectly good C code that wouldn't compile on the Raspberry Pi because strnstr() isn't a native Linux call. Plug this in with a simple #include "strnstr.c" and you're off to the races.

I did not write the code, so read the embedded license for who to contact if you have issues or find bugs.
